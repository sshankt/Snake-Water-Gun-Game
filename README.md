Welcome to the Snake Water Gun Game 2.0, 
an upgraded and fun take on the classic game! Built using Python, 
this game features voice feedback using the pyttsx3 library and a user-friendly text interface. Challenge the computer in a quick, random game of chance and see if you can win! 🎮
## 🎮 Game Overview
The Snake Water Gun game is similar to the well-known Rock Paper Scissors game, where:

🐍 Snake drinks Water 💦
💦 Water rusts Gun 🔫
🔫 Gun kills Snake 🐍
The game involves the user making a choice between Snake, Water, or Gun, while the computer randomly selects one. The game announces the result through both text and voice feedback.

## ✨ Features
Voice Feedback: Using the pyttsx3 library, the game will speak the introduction and results.
Randomized Opponent: The computer randomly chooses between Snake, Water, and Gun, making every round unpredictable.
Simple & Fun Interface: Easy to understand and play with text-based prompts for user input.
Result Handling: Clear winner/loser announcements with tie detection.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
To run the game, you will need:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
Required libraries installed via pip:
pyttsx3 for voice support.
random (comes pre-installed with Python).

## 🚀 How to Play
When you start the game, you will be welcomed by the system with both text and voice.

You’ll see the options:

Press s for 🐍 Snake
Press w for 💦 Water
Press g for 🔫 Gun
Enter your choice, and the computer will choose randomly between Snake, Water, and Gun.

The result will be displayed, and the system will also announce it through the voice feedback.

## 🧩 Game Logic
The computer randomly selects between Snake, Water, or Gun.
The user's input is compared with the computer’s choice, and the winner is determined using the following rules:
Snake 🐍 beats Water 💦
Water 💦 beats Gun 🔫
Gun 🔫 beats Snake 🐍
If both the user and the computer choose the same option, the game is a draw.
